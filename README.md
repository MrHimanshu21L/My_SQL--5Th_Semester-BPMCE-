This repository contains Database Management System (DBMS) laboratory work implemented using Oracle Database 21c 🏢 and MySQL 🐬. The primary objective of this lab work is to develop strong practical skills in relational database management by applying theoretical DBMS concepts through structured SQL experiments and real-world use cases.

The repository is designed to help students understand how databases are created, managed, and queried efficiently in enterprise and open-source environments. Oracle Database 21c is used to explore advanced and industry-level database features, while MySQL provides hands-on experience with a widely used, lightweight, and open-source relational database system.

✨ Key Features and Experiments Covered:

🏗️ Database and table creation using SQL

🧩 Implementation of DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL commands

🔐 Application of constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL

🔍 Query execution using SELECT, JOINS, and SUBQUERIES

📊 Use of aggregate functions and GROUP BY / HAVING clauses

👁️ Creation and management of VIEWS and INDEXES

⚙️ Introduction to PL/SQL programming in Oracle 21c

All SQL scripts are organized in a clear and systematic folder structure 📁 to ensure easy understanding, execution, and reuse. The experiments focus on accuracy, readability, and best practices in SQL writing.

This repository serves as a practical learning reference for students studying DBMS and related subjects. It strengthens conceptual clarity, improves query-writing efficiency, and bridges the gap between academic knowledge and real-world database applications 🚀.
