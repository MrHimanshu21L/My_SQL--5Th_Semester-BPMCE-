This repository presents Database Management System (DBMS) laboratory work implemented using Oracle Database 21c and MySQL. It focuses on building strong practical skills in relational database management by applying core DBMS concepts through structured and well-documented SQL experiments.

The work demonstrates how databases are designed, managed, and queried across both enterprise-level and open-source environments. Oracle Database 21c is used to explore advanced and industry-relevant database features, while MySQL provides hands-on experience with a widely adopted and lightweight relational database system.
